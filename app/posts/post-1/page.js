                        The Resemble AI is an integrated service that has tools and add-ons that help the user to deal with audio and text content in one place, with a greater focus on audio content. This includes generating audio content from scratch, manipulating audio content, and even creating it from other audio sources.
                        What distinguishes Resemble AI is its simulation of sounds in a very human-like manner, which is hinted at in the name of the service, Resemble, which suffers from similarity or simulation. The intent of the platform is not to create and generate audio content, but rather to bring it closer to the human voice through artificial intelligence improvements.

                        Text-to-speech services existed even before the advent of artificial intelligence services, but they are very limited, allowing you to convert only short texts, 
                        and using computer-generated digital voices. The Rsemble AI service offers something closer to humans in terms of simulating voice, and with artificial intelligence that supports reading texts in different languages.

                        When converting written text to audio, you have several options to speak the text phonetically. There are dozens of types of voices from women, men, elders, young children, and more. 
                        This allows one user to manipulate the audio according to their situation, one wants to share an audio video on YouTube and the other just wants to prank their friend.
